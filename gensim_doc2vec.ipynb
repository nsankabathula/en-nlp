Your Annual Percentage Rate is\\nvariable and will increase or decrease if the Prime Rate as published in the\\nWall Street Journal (\"Index\") increases or decreases. We figure the Finance\\nCharge by applying a periodic rate, which corresponds to the Annual\\nPercentage Rate, to the Average Daily Balance. The Average Daily Balance\\nis determined as follows: For Purchases: The \"Average Daily Balance\" for\\nPurchases is determined by adding all the outstanding advance balances\\nand billed but unpaid finance charges for each calendar day of the billing\\nperiod, and then subtracting all payments, credits and cash advances for the\\nbilling period in which they were made, and then dividing the total by the\\nnumber of days in that billing period. For Cash Advances: Each daily balance\\nof Cash Advances is determined by adding to the outstanding unpaid balance\\nof Cash Advances at the beginning of the billing cycle any new Cash\\nAdvances posted to your account, and subtracting any payments as received\\nor credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Finance\\nCharges. The periodic rate and corresponding Annual Percentage Rate for\\neach type of card account is shown on your Addendum to Open-end Credit\\nPlan.\\nGrace Periods: VISA: You can avoid finance charges on purchases by\\npaying the full amount of the New Balance of Purchases each month within\\n25 days of your statement closing date (\"Grace Period\").

Cash\\nAdvances for all Mastercard and VISA cards: There is no time period within\\nwhich to pay to avoid a periodic finance charge on cash advances and the\\nfinance charge will accrue from the date the cash advance is posted to your\\naccount.\\nHow to Calculate the Finance Charge: The Finance Charge is calculated at\\nthe Annual Percentage Rate disclosed above (or as amended from time to\\ntime) on the average daily balance of purchase and cash advances you\\nmake, and any debit adjustments the credit union makes, during the billing\\ncycle.

If you elect not to pay the entire New Balance shown on your previous monthly statement within that 25-day period, a Finance Charge will be imposed on the unpaid average daily \\nbalance of such Credit Purchases from the previous statement closing date and on new Credit Purchases from the date of posting to your account during the current billing cycle, and will continue to accrue \\nuntil the closing date of the billing cycle preceding the date on which the entire New Balance is paid in full or until the date of payment if more than 25 days from the closing date.\\n\\nThe Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the average daily balance of Credit Purchases, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances \\nduring the billing cycle by the number of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Credit Purchases is determined by adding to the outstanding unpaid balance of Credit Purchases at the beginning of the \\nbilling cycle any new Credit Purchases posted to your account, and subtracting any payments as received and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Finance Charges.
